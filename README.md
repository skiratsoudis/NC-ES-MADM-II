## Overview
This repository hosts the **reproducible reference implementation** of **NC-ES-MADM II** (Neural-Consensus Entropy–Synergy Multi-Attribute Decision-Making, version II), as introduced in the manuscript:

**“Calibrated Neural-Consensus Entropy–Synergy Multicriteria Ranking with Robustness Diagnostics: The NC-ES-MADM II Framework.”**

NC-ES-MADM II unifies:
- entropy-driven **objective weighting**,
- reliability-aware **neural-consensus aggregation** of subjective weights,
- closed-form **objective–subjective integration** on the simplex,
- alternative-level **probabilistic ranking** via a decision distribution \(P(Y)\),
- **information-theoretic diagnostics** (e.g., coupling/decisiveness/distinction),
- optional **WIN-supervised calibration** (proper scoring rules + temperature scaling),
- **robustness and sensitivity/elasticity** diagnostics under structured perturbations.

The design priority is **auditability and interpretability**: all intermediate objects (conditional matrix, weights, posteriors, indices, robustness outputs) are available for inspection.

---

## Relation to the manuscript (reproducibility claim)
This repository constitutes the **official computational platform** supporting the empirical results, robustness diagnostics, and figure generation reported in the accompanying manuscript.

Using the scripts in `code/` and `plots/` with the datasets in `data/`, a reader can reproduce:
- the case-study pipeline outputs,
- the reported weights and decision distributions,
- the diagnostic indices,
- the robustness/sensitivity deliverables,
- and all manuscript figures generated by the plotting scripts.

---

## Repository structure
A typical layout is:

- `code/`  
  Core implementation scripts for the NC-ES-MADM II pipeline (weights, posteriors, diagnostics, robustness, optional training/calibration).

- `plots/`  
  Scripts used to generate the manuscript figures (e.g., Figures 4.1–4.13 and 5.1).

- `data/`  
  Input datasets used in the case study (raw and/or processed).

- `results/`  
  Reproducible outputs (tables, intermediate objects, exported figure files).

> If your current repository uses a slightly different naming scheme (e.g., `DOC/` vs `plots/`), keep it consistent, but preserve the same logical separation: **inputs → code → outputs → figures**.

---

## Requirements
- R (recent version recommended)
- Standard R packages for data handling and plotting (see script headers)

---

## Quick start (minimal)
1. Download/clone this repository.
2. Open R (or RStudio) in the repository root directory.
3. Run the core model script(s) in `code/` to reproduce tables/outputs.
4. Run the plotting scripts in `plots/` to reproduce figures.

---

## Reproducing manuscript figures
The `plots/` directory contains dedicated scripts for figure generation:
- `NC-ES-MADM II MODEL_plots (FIG. 4.1-4.6).R`
- `NC-ES-MADM II MODEL_plots (FIG. 4.7-4.13).R`
- `NC-ES-MADM II MODEL_plots (FIG. 5.1).R`

Run them after reproducing the corresponding data objects in `results/` (or ensure the plot scripts point to the correct input paths).

---

## Reproducibility and determinism
- Deterministic implementation (no stochastic components in the baseline pipeline).
- No hyperparameter tuning is required for the core pipeline.
- Simplex-preserving aggregation for all weight vectors and alternative distributions.
- Intermediate quantities are reported for full auditability.

If any optional resampling/bootstrapping is activated, set a fixed seed in the script headers to obtain identical outputs.

---

## Intended use
This repository is intended for:
- peer review and reproducibility assessment,
- methodological validation and benchmarking,
- educational and research use in decision analytics,
- extension to logistics, policy, and socio-economic evaluation contexts.
